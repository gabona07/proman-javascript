# Assignment: ProMan

## E-mail from the client

From: `Mark Big <ceo@thepartner.com>`

Subject: `Welcome on board for the ProMan project!`

```
Today everyone wants to create a new project management tool,
and we're no exception either. We'd like to implement 
something similar to Trello, so we can say we have our own tool!

We call it: ProMan

Jacob, our senior full-stack developer
started to work on the project already. 
He made sure to have a properly collected backlog,
and he started to work on the wireframe of the application. 

Unfortunately Jacob was late one day, he arrived to work at 9:02,
so we had to fire him. Job starts at 9am, he had to learn it.

Now it's your job to finish the project!
Send us the sprint backlog ASAP, and we'll meet at the demo!

Remember, we need complete user stories and quality work!

Mark

## Design requirements

As you have gained some knowledge in the previous assignments and SI week about user interface design, the [customer
would love](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1327533/71522286-4f752600-28c4-11ea-9c9c-5622fdd42ad8.png) to get an application which is easy
to use at first glance, functionality is straightforward and looks nice on different screen sizes if possible.

They imagine the app as a 'one pager' where all the boards are shown and when one is clicked/opened then the
corresponding cards are shown. Their screen plan is not too sophisticated but seems a good base for the work:
